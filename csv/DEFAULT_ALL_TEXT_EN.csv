You can take the written test in Trabia,
but the field exam is here, and plus,
once you become a SeeD, you'll be
stationed here in Balamb.  That's why

Central Square, was nowhere to be found!

I had to deliver this message 'cause
I didn't want points deducted.
Well, I ended up finding squad B
but somewhere completely different.
And the squad leader was going berserk!

But anyway, I remained calm and
delivered the message.
I think that is what got me
the points...

Anyway, I'm really excited
to be a SeeD.

congratulated us.  Seems like a nice guy.

mission, and what do I find?
Garden in chaos!
First of all, let me tell you about
my first mission(among other events.)
{NewPage}
Oh yeah!  Booyaka!
I'm doing fine!
Our first mission was in Timber.
I can't tell you details about it, but
in one word, it was a failure.
{NewPage}
I keep telling myself the enemy
was stronger than us...
Grrr... We should've won...!
Well, an accident happened during our
mission.  The sorceress appeared!
Yes, THE sorceress!
Her name's Edea.
{NewPage}
Anyway, Seifer appeared outta nowhere.
Then Edea took him off to who knows where.
We tried to make it back to Garden,
but the trains were down
so we ended up going to
Galbadia Garden.
{NewPage}
That Garden is quite different
from ours.  It kinda reminded me
of the army or something...",""
"{Yellow}【Back at Garden II】{White}
Well, we received a new order
at Galbadia Garden, but I don't
think I can write that here.
Based on the outcome, well...
we failed again.
The enemy's way too strong!
{NewPage}
Booyaka!
Our target was Sorceress Edea.
(Oops, I wrote it...)
Hmmm... The most recent and infamous
sorceress is Adel, right?
The sorceress behind the Sorceress
War, back when we were kids...?
{NewPage}
We learned in history class that
Sorceress Adel dissappeared and the
war just kinda ended, right?
A sorceress inherits the power from another
sorceress, so I think Edea's the one
that received Adel's powers.
{NewPage}
Just when Sorceress Edea and the
President of Galbadia joined forces,
she wiped out the president.
Which means, Sorceress Edea is now
controlling Galbadia.
This is exactly like the Sorceress War
with Esthar.  Time to bring out the SeeDs!",""
"{Yellow}【Back at Garden III】{White}
Well, we failed our mission
and we even failed to retreat.
As a result, we ended up in a prison
in the desert of Galbadia.
Our leader was tortured and we were
locked up, but we managed to escape!
{NewPage}
When you're locked up, the only thing
you think about is escaping, right?
I hope we did the right thing.
Or was that against orders?
Oh well...
{NewPage}
After we escaped, I heard some
terrible news.  Edea was going
to get rid of all SeeDs
by lauching missiles at Garden!
{NewPage}
It's quite obvious that Edea
despises SeeD and wants to
get rid of Garden,
which trains the SeeDs.
{NewPage}
Anyway, after I heard about the missiles
I just couldn't stand still.
So I asked our leader, {Squall}
(who did a great job, by the way),
to divide up the party so that one team
could infiltrate the missile base.",""
"{Yellow}【Back at Garden IV】{White}
The 2 teams were the messenger team
and the missile base team. I was on
the missile team and was messing
around with the computers to save Garden.
...I heard it was a close call?
But as long as we're all safe, right?
{NewPage}
Anyway, after messing up the computer,
we tried to escape but, oh-oh...!
We couldn't get out of the base!
Never in my whole life did I ever think
so seriously that I was going to die...
{NewPage}
But we were very lucky.
We were able to get inside the robot
we were fighting.  Its armor was what
actually saved us from the
explosion in the end.
That's the only time I was thankful
for Galbadia's weaponry.",""
"{Yellow}【Back at Garden V】{White}
So anyway, we were inside that robot
and made our way over here.
...Well, not exactly.
We were inside but we had no idea
how to control it.  To make matters
worse, we were picked up by the Galbadian
army and brought over to FH.
{NewPage}
We were pressing all these buttons
trying to get out, when we realized
we were fighting with {Squall} and
the others. I'm sorry.
We weren't attacking you.
Just trying to get out!
It's true!  Really!

is safe. (It is, right?)

I went to visit Trabia.

Yeah, they were in high-spirits.

it eventually rubs off on you.

And also...
The side effects of the GF
The stuff about losing memory...
Well, sure enough, it happened to me.
I just wasn't aware of it.

When all of us were talking,
we started to remember a lot of stuff.
Even stuff we didn't want
to remember.
It made me really think that day.

Sorceress Edea was someone very
special to me.  But still, I'll fight.
Because I'm a SeeD.

I thought the battles were over.
But it seems like they'll continue.
I wrote before how Sorceress Edea,
or Matron, was very special to me.
{NewPage}
She was a good sorceress after all.
She was possessed by a different
sorceress, but she's still in danger.
Even if she is being used, it'll be tough
fighting with Matron...
{NewPage}
It was the future sorceress, Ultimecia
who was controlling Matron.
Her objective is ‘time compression'.
I wonder what that is?
What happens when time is compressed?
{NewPage}
I'm more afraid of having to fight
the Matron than worrying about
this time compression thing.

what happened to {Rinoa}?
I know {Squall} is suffering.
Isn't there anything we can do?",""

gambled to try to cover travel expenses.

about how he tried to get to Esthar.

You sure travel a lot, Sir Laguna!",""
"Do you understand this picture?
Sir Laguna even wrote ‘Esthar's Secret'.

This is where Sir Laguna went scouting.

Was it ok for this to be published?
I guess he really needed the money!",""
"This is a hotel in Timber.
It's full of Galbadian soldiers.
{NewPage}
You'll still find soldiers there,
but this is a little too much, huh?
{NewPage}
Yes, this is a picture of when Timber
was occupied by Galbadia.
{NewPage}
Sir Laguna tried to stay at this hotel,
but it was used to house soldiers.
{NewPage}
Why are these articles from that period?
{NewPage}
That's because that was the period when
Laguna actually wrote the articles.
{NewPage}
So, all the magazines with Laguna's
articles are all old and worn out.

I wonder how old Sir Laguna is now?
I betcha he's a dandy old guy!",""

stay at the hotel but ran out of money.

though, out of respect for Sir Laguna.

"[A Report on the Monsters
 Breeding on this Ship]
{NewPage}
We eliminated all the monsters
on this ship, but we leave this
report in case they breed again.
{NewPage}
The monsters are 3-6 meters tall,
extremely hostile and savage.
{NewPage}
They are ferocious carnivores
and have attacked and devoured
numerous crew members.
{NewPage}
There are 8 independent monsters,
but they are also one entity.
The monsters can be killed
through regular combat, but it
must be done systematically.
{NewPage}
For example, if you kill one
monster in a certain place, and kill
another one in a different place,
the first monster you killed
may be revived by another monster.
{NewPage}
The 8 monsters work together to
maintain their colony.
{NewPage}
They seem immortal, but they are not.
Killing them in a certain order
prevents them from reviving
one another.
{NewPage}
Here is a more clear example.  Let's
name the 8 monsters with the letters
A-H.
{NewPage}
Let's say monster B can revive
monster A and monster D can revive
monster C, and so on.
{NewPage}
If you kill monster B right after you
kill monster A, monster A will never
be able to revive.
{NewPage}
We have confirmed that the monsters that
are paired up have similar features.
{NewPage}
That is all the information we have.
Good luck.",""

were getting smarter.

the people by offering them half of his
body along with his powers.",""

He appeared before the confused Zebalgas

was corrupt and possessed no real power.

Hyne's cast-off skin.
